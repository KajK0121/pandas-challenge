Conclusions
Summarizes the analysis (5 points)
This dataset shows the passing percentage of district and charter schools in maths and reading. This data explores whether there is a correlation between the total budget of each school and their passing rate in maths and reading.

Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)
Charter schools have a higher average score in Maths and Reading (83.47 and 83.90) in comparison to district schools (76.96 and 80.97). The overall passing of charter schools (90.4) are significantly higher than district schools(53.6).

Looking at the spending ranges per student at each school , it seems that the higher the spending is per student the lower the overall passing percentage is.
